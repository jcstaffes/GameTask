I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The Task 2,3,5,7 in class RailroadInk.
* The Task 9 in class Viewer,and method click and drop,which is to drag the image and collect the boardstring to gain score and valid placement.
* All methods in Board class except getOffset method.
* In Tile class,finish all methods which are after generateTile method.
* All the methods which are after exit() method in Viewer class.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <...> came from a discussion with <...>

* The code in class <...> uses an idea suggested by <...>
