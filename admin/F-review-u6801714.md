Review Comments:

1. Task 6:List every condition to confirm the boardstring,this can be simplified.
2.Task 6:test testGood and testDuplicate is failed.
3.Task 6:Should make the same tile not appear again(use arraylist or hashmap)
4.Task 6:The method of this part of code is appropriate to the whole program.The idea is right,just need to modify. 
5.Task 6:It follow Java code conventions,and the style is consistent throughtout,it is easy to understand.
6.Task 3:The best feature of this code is he use the substing method to collect the 5 character string which is tile.
7.Task 3:The board sting is divided into some tile strings,so it can be more easier to understand code instead of using charAt.
8.Task 3:The code is well-decumented and the program decomposition is appropriate.
9.Task 3:It follow Java code conventions,the style is understandable.
10.Task 8:This code need some comment,or it will be hard to understand.
11.Task 8:The program decomposition is not prefectly appropriate.
12.Task 8:This code need some public method to simplify this task.
10.Task 8:This task is very complicated,so i recommend to use DFS(Depth-First-Search).
11.Task 8:The code is well documented and the program decomposition is appropriate.
12.Task 8:Still need to add some good structure to make the code easier to understand and read.
13.Task 8:It follow Java code conventions and it record score,which can be used in task 9.
14.Task 8:Because this code is not completed,it is not consistent throughout.
15.Task 8:This code has an influence on the further code.
16.Task 8:If the code is completed,the structure of this code should be formal and understandable.
17.Task 8:The final should add more comments so the others can do next.
