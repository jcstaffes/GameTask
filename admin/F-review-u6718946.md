Review Comments:

1. Task 5: Use a series of if/else statement to check whether two tiles are connect or not.
2. Task 5: Tht code is well-documented and the program decomposition is appropriate.But too many conditions in one sentence is a little hard to read.
3. Task 5: The code follows Java code conventions.
4. Task 5: The code can achieve the expected purpose with no error.
5. Task 7: Use "Random()" to roll the dice.
6. Task 7: The code is well-documented and the program decomposition is appropriate.
7. Task 7: The code follows Java code conventions.
8. Task 7: The code can achieve the expected purpose with no error.
9: Task 7: After improving, the code now is very concise and friendly for reading.
10. Tile.tileReset: The code uses so many if/else to set four sides of each tile.
11. Tile.tileReset: The program decomposition is appropriate.
12. Tile.tileReset: The code follows Java code conventions.
13. Tile.tileReset: The code can achieve the expected purpose with no error.
14. Tile.tileReset: Although the code has no error, it maybe better to use enum rather than use so many if/else if. Enum is more clear and low possibility to make mistakes.
